  <h1>Stephen's Cats</h1>
  <h2>Written by <strong>Stephen Vanore</strong></h2>

  <p>I have two cats and their names are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tiger</li>
    <li>Lily</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They are interested in the following activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Going outside and eating grass</li>
    <li>Chilling in the Catio</li>
    <li>Hanging out on the couch</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Occassionally the neighbor's Cat, Mimi, will come and visit as well!</p>
  <p>Thanks for reading about my cats</p>
